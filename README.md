# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
This Geo Mapping project was a discovery of the power of Python and mapping with real time data.  The exercise provided PlanMyTrip with fundamental code to:
   * seach locations and their nearby hotels by region as well as by high and low temperature ranges
   * provide travellers information on temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed and current weather conditions

Selecting 4 cities that met the customer's basic criteria, the project provided an itinerary to travel through 4 ideal cities within their selected region.
