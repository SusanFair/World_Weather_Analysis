# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
This Geo Mapping project was a discovery of the power of Python and mapping with real time date.  The exercise provided a PlanMyTrip fundamental code to:
   * seach locations and nearby hotels by region as well a high and low temperature ranges
   * provide travellers information on temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed as well a current weather conditions

Selecting 4 cities that met the customers basic criteria, the project provided an itinerary to travel through 4 ideal cities within their selected region.
